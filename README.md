## Homelab

This is a place for all infra stuff at home. There are currently three sites + a cloud environment.

- Olympus (G29)
- Erebus (B22)
- Pythia (B216)
- Aether (Hetzner)

With the main infra at Olympus.

### Infra

This repo uses OpenTofu and NixOS to manage the infrastructure. Most of the configuration is done using Nix.

TODO/add:

- Backup system!!! (restic)
- Git server (Forgejo/Gitea)
- A simple cluster to learn about orchestration (k8s, k3s or nomad)
- Local LLM agent
- Ad blocking DNS
- Dashboard (glance/homepage)
- Migrate Hermes to Nix

### Provisioning hosts

Boot into a NixOS live ISO, or try your luck with `nixos-anywhere`. Using `nixos-anywhere`:

```
nix run github:nix-community/nixos-anywhere -- --flake #name <user>@<host> --build-on-remote
```

If you want to do it manually (eg. there might be some data already there, and you want to be careful). Read on.

Get this repo to the host.

One way is to use:

```bash
#on the host
sudo passwd root
mkdir config && cd config && git init

#from your machine
ssh-copy-id nixos@<host>
git remote add nixos git@<host>:/home/nixos/config
git push nixos

#on the host
git checkout main
```

Then on the host run:

```bash
export host=<name>
nix-shell -p disko
sudo disko -m disko --flake .#$host
sudo nixos-install --root /mnt --no-root-password --flake .#$host
# Important! If the system has a zfs pool, otherwise it will fail to import on boot
sudo umount -l /mnt && sudo zpool export -a
```

## Credits

This configuration is heavily inspired by [oddlama's](https://github.com/oddlama/nix-config) configuration, with many parts taken directly (and some modified and simplified). Huge thanks for all them!

Other sources of inspiration:

- [notthebee](https://github.com/notthebee/nix-config/) - His YouTube video pushed me to finally move to a NixOS based setup.
- [PopeRigby](https://codeberg.org/PopeRigby/config) - Authelia setup is based on his config.
