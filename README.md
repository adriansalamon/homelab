## Homelab

This is a place for all infra stuff at home. There are currently three sites + a
cloud environment.

- Olympus (G29)
- Erebus (B22)
- Pythia (B216)
- Aether (Hetzner)

With the main infra at Olympus.

### Infra

This repo uses OpenTofu and NixOS to manage the infrastructure. Most of the
configuration is done using Nix.

TODO/add:

- Git server (Forgejo/Gitea)
- A simple cluster to learn about orchestration (k8s, k3s or nomad)
- Ad blocking DNS
- Dashboard (glance/homepage)

### Secrets üîê

All secrets, e.g. passwords, API tokens, etc. are stored as age encrypted files.
These are encrypted using two YubiKeys (one offline backup). Using
[`agenix-rekey`](https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey), secrets are
rekeyed/encrypted per host/server. Please see the documentation for the library
for more information.

Semi-secret data, like domain names, email addresses, and IP addresses, which
are not secrets in the traditional sense (I'm fine if they are in the Nix store)
but I would still like to keep hidden publicly on GitHub, are encrypted using
[`git-agecrypt`](https://github.com/vlaci/git-agecrypt). To set up after cloning
repo, use:

```bash
git-agecrypt init
git-agecrypt config -i secrets/yubikey-identity.pub
```

### Provisioning hosts

TODO: figure out how to make this work with `git-agecrypt`.

Boot into a NixOS live ISO, or try your luck with `nixos-anywhere`. Using
`nixos-anywhere`:

```
nix run github:nix-community/nixos-anywhere -- --flake #name <user>@<host> --build-on-remote
```

If you want to do it manually (e.g. there might be some data already there, and
you want to be careful). Read on. You can build a NixOS live ISO with
preconfigured ssh keys:

```bash
nix build --print-out-paths --no-link github:adriansalamon/homelab#live-iso
```

Then on the host run:

```bash
export host=<name>
nix-shell -p disko
sudo disko -m disko --flake github:adriansalamon/homelab#$host
sudo nixos-install --root /mnt --no-root-password --flake github:adriansalamon/homelab#$host
# Important! If the system has a zfs pool, otherwise it will fail to import on boot
sudo umount -l /mnt && sudo zpool export -a
```

### OpenTofu

Some things are managed using OpenTofu, e.g. Cloudflare DNS, Hetzner Cloud, and Consul.
To run, use:

```bash
nix run #tofu <command, e.g. plan|apply>
```

This also automatically sets up a tunnel to a Consul server.

## Credits

This configuration is heavily inspired by
[oddlama's](https://github.com/oddlama/nix-config) awesome configuration, with
many parts taken directly (and some modified and simplified). Huge thanks to
them!

Other sources of inspiration:

- [notthebee](https://github.com/notthebee/nix-config/) - His YouTube video
  pushed me to finally move to a NixOS based setup. -
  [PopeRigby](https://codeberg.org/PopeRigby/config) - Authelia setup is based
  on his config.
